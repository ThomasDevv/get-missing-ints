# get-missing-ints
Retrieves missing integers in an array if any.

# How does this script work?
This script works by iterating over the array passed, checking if incrementing the element at the current index of the iteration by one returns a value equivalent to the next index. Hence checking if there's a missing integer and informing you what the missing integer is by decrementing the next index by one. Cool, right?
